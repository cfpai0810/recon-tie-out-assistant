# lib/errors.py: friendly error handling for a non-technical audience
# =============================================================================
# A business user must never see a Python traceback. Every failure becomes a
# plain-language message that says what went wrong and what to do. This wraps
# the Claude calls (bad key, rate limit, network) and any unexpected error.
