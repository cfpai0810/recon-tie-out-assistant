# =============================================================================
# lib/key_gate.py : the bring-your-own-key gate (foundation component)
# =============================================================================
# Renders the API-key input, holds the key ONLY in session state for the live
# session, and builds a per-session Anthropic client. The key is never written
# to disk, never logged, never stored server-side. This is reused by every
# tool page.
#
# Honest disclosure (per the master plan): "used only for your session, never
# stored", not "never leaves your device", because the key does reach the
# server to make the Claude call. Users who want their key to never leave
# their machine are pointed to the GitHub download.
